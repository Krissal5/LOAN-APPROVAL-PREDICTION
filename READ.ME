# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant details such as income, education, credit history, and property area.

The project follows an **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and final prediction.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical loan application records with the following information:

* Applicant demographics (Gender, Married, Dependents, Education)
* Financial details (ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount)
* Loan details (Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area)
* Target variable: **Loan_Status** (Y = Approved, N = Rejected)

The dataset was split into:

* **Training data** – used for model training
* **Testing data** – used for final model evaluation

## 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding

* Loaded CSV files
* Checked shape, columns, and missing values

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values using mean/mode
* Fixed data types
* Removed non-informative ID column (`Loan_ID`) from features

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed loan approval rate
* Studied impact of income, credit history, and education
* Used visualizations (bar plots, box plots)

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering

* Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding
* Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
* Ensured consistent preprocessing for training and testing data

### 5️⃣ Model Building

The following classification models were trained:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated on the test dataset using:

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision, Recall, and F1-score

### 7️⃣ Conclusion

* **Random Forest** performed best overall
* **Credit_History** was the most important feature
* Applicants with good credit history and stable income had higher approval probability
